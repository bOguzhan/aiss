Overview

This project provides a complete, peer-to-peer (P2P) network solution that enables a client to establish a direct connection with an application server located behind a Carrier-Grade Network Address Translator (CGNAT). The system is built using Python and consists of three core components: a signaling server, an application server, and a client. It effectively bypasses the limitations of traditional NATs by using a combination of STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) and UDP hole punching.
The Problem: CGNAT

CGNAT is a networking architecture where a single public IP address is shared by multiple private networks. This makes it impossible for an external client to initiate a connection to a specific internal device, as the incoming request cannot be routed to the correct private IP address. This project solves this problem by using a third-party server to coordinate the connection, allowing both sides to punch a "hole" through their respective NATs.
The Solution: A Three-Part System

The application's architecture is a common pattern for P2P networking and is divided into three distinct roles:

    Signaling Server: This is the only component that requires a publicly routable IP address. Its sole purpose is to act as a rendezvous point. It stores the public IP and port information of the application server and facilitates the introduction between the client and server. It does not handle the actual data transfer between peers.

    Application Server: The application server, located behind a CGNAT, registers itself with the signaling server. It uses a STUN client to discover its own public IP and port as seen by the world. It provides this information, along with a unique ID, to the signaling server. It then listens for a P2P connection request from the client and performs its part of the UDP hole punching.

    Client: The client connects to the signaling server and requests the network information of the desired application server using its unique ID. Upon receiving the target's public IP and port, the client initiates the P2P connection by sending UDP packets to the target, performing its side of the hole punching.

Communication Flow

The entire process follows these steps:

    The Application Server starts up. It queries a public STUN server to learn its public IP and port.

    The Application Server connects to the Signaling Server and registers its unique ID, public IP, and port.

    The Client starts up. It connects to the Signaling Server and requests the public IP and port for the specified Application Server ID.

    The Signaling Server sends the requested network information back to the Client. It also sends a notification to the Application Server that a client is attempting to connect.

    Simultaneously, both the Client and the Application Server begin sending UDP packets to each other's discovered public IP and port. This is the UDP hole punching process.

    The packets from the client create a temporary "hole" in its NAT's firewall, and the packets from the server do the same.

    The packets sent from one peer will eventually pass through the hole created by the other, establishing a direct, bidirectional UDP connection.

    Once the connection is established, the Client and Application Server can communicate directly without any further involvement from the Signaling Server.
